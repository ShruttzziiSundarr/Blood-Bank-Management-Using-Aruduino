The proposed methodology for developing a health monitoring system 
using Arduino Uno can be divided into the following phases:
 Design and Development:
In this phase, the hardware and software components of the system will 
be designed and developed. This includes selecting and interfacing 
sensors for vital signs monitoring, designing the circuit layout for 
Arduino Uno, and programming the microcontroller board to collect and 
transmit the data. The design and development will be carried out using 
the Arduino integrated development environment (IDE) and various 
sensors and modules.
 Testing and Validation:
In this phase, the system will be tested for accuracy and reliability using 
a group of volunteers. The collected data will be compared with 
traditional health monitoring systems to ensure the system's accuracy 
and reliability. Any errors or inconsistencies will be addressed in this 
phase, and improvements will be made to the system if necessary.
 Integration and Deployment:
In this phase, the system will be integrated into a central server or 
mobile application for storage and analysis. The system will be deployed 
in various settings such as hospitals, homes, and remote areas for 
continuous monitoring of vital signs. A user-friendly interface will be 
developed for providing real-time feedback on health status.
 Evaluation and Improvement:
In this phase, the system's performance will be evaluated in real-world 
scenarios. Feedback from healthcare providers and individuals using the 
system will be collected and analyzed for identifying any shortcomings 
or areas for improvement. The system will be improved accordingly to 
ensure optimal performance and user satisfaction.
In conclusion, the proposed methodology for developing a health 
monitoring system using Arduino Uno includes design and development, 
testing and validation, integration and deployment, and evaluation and 
improvement. The methodology ensures that the system is accurate, 
reliable, and user-friendly, and can be deployed in various settings for 
continuous monitoring of vital signs
A block diagram and flowchart were used as guides to visualize the 
arrangement of steps to be followed throughout the system management 
process. When the cycle stream was created, it directed essential periods 
of any future activities from the beginning to the end of a system. Circuit 
diagrams were utilized for the planning, development, and support of 
electrical and electronic gears. For a well-developed system, these 
diagrams were truly significant. Figure 1 shows a block diagram of the 
proposed system. The system block diagram shows that when the power 
of the system is switched on, the sensor starts taking values. Here, the 
system has two types of sensors for measuring SpO2, pulse rate, and 
temperature. The sensors measure the physiological data from a human 
body and then pass the analog values to the Arduino, which converts 
them into digital data. The server sends the measured data to the mobile 
application and displays the data through an LCD display 
simultaneously. From the mobile application and device, users can 
monitor the temperature level, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and pulse rate.
